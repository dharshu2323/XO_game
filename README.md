# XO_game

This is a XO game developed in the Android studio. In this, there are two options either you can play with your friends(2-player) else with the computer and declare either win or draw

👉2-player game 👥: This is a simple program with infinite loops until all boxes are filled.

👉Play with computer 🤖: In this mode where human and computer i.e. AI will play together. The algorithm used here is the Min-Max algorithm

📍Min-Max algorithm 👇
* It is a backtracking algorithm used in the game theory for optimal solutions.
* One player is Min and the other one is Max
* Its time complexity is O(b^m)
* This algorithm applies Depth First Search(DFS), we need to reach the terminal node and then backtrack as recursion
